It is an interactive interface between the package manager [pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/). It checks periodically for updates.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install use the program `make`:\r\n\r\n    #  make install\r\n    \r\n        Generates all scripts, services and timers and installs them to the\r\n        correct locations. As a result the timer is started and will be\r\n        started at every following boot.\r\n    \r\n    #  make uninstall\r\n    \r\n        Removes and disables all scripts, services and timers. Also cleans up\r\n        the source code directory.\r\n\r\n**Note that you must change the username in the `Makefile`.** Without the change notifications won't be displayed.\r\n\r\nThe default startup delay at boot is set to `5` minutes and the default interval of the synchronization is set to `30` minutes. Feel free to modify these settings in the `Makefile`.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nlastest GPL-license (see LICENSE-file)\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2015 NIPE-SYSTEMS, [http://www.nipe-systems.de](http://www.nipe-systems.de)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
